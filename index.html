      The original game was made by Elendov and it's avaiable on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1999740/THE_BUTTON_by_Elendow/">Steam</a><br />
      This game is merely a replica of the game provided in the link<br />
      and serves as an exercise to see if I can replicate it in HTML.
